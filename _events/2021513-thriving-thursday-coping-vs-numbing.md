As human beings we often seek to rid ourselves of emotional discomfort
by engaging in numbing behaviors. However, these behaviors do not
mitigate our emotions. Numbing behaviors look different for each of us.
These behaviors can look like using alcohol or other drugs in excess,
spending extended periods of time playing videogames or going down a
social media rabbit hole. Rather than numbing ourselves, this Thriving
Thursday we will focus on coping tools that can support us in managing
feelings and meeting life's challenges. This group will be facilitated
by OITE Wellness Advisor Jenn Wiggins.
