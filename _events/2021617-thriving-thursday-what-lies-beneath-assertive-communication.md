Addressing conflict assertively can be helpful in respectfully
expressing our opinions, needs, wants, and rights; however, this can be
difficult and stress inducing for a variety of reasons. Join us this
Thriving Thursday as we unpack some of the complicating dynamics that
impact our ability to assertively communicate with others and what lies
beneath the struggles we may have in doing so.
