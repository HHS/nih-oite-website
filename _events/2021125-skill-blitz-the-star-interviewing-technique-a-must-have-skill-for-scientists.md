Learn and practice the STAR behavioral interviewing technique. This will
help you answer tough questions on interviews like, \"Tell me about a
time you struggled in lab,\" or Tell me about your best example of
leadership\". These questions will be asked during industry, academic
jobs, and interviews and interviews for graduate and professional
school.

Designed as a quick talk, there will be a 15 minute discussion on the
topic...then we will go to breakout rooms to practice. 

(due to the interactive nature of this session it will not be
recorded...info on interviewing is available via this video:
