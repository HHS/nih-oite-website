Feeling anxiety in response to something major in our life, whether that
be an exam, an interview, a speech, or presentation is normal. Too often
though we find ourselves becoming overwhelmed by our anxiety which
hinders our ability to perform at optimal levels. Join us this Thriving
Thursday as we discuss strategies to better manage that anxiety, not
avoid it or push it away, so we can use it as fuel. To access this
event, the link can be found in the daily stress management email.
