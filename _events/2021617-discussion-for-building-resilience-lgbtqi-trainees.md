Please join this warm and welcoming group of LGBTQI+ trainees to enjoy a
safe space and be yourself. Let's share our unique resources,
experiences and challenges to help you feel connected and supported
during your time as an NIH trainee. Whether you are feeling isolated,
unsure or just want to expand your community, this LGBTQI+ group is for
you.  Labels are less important than your feeling connected to our
community; come join us wherever you are on your own personal journey.
This session is open to trainees at all levels (postbac, grad, and
postdoc).Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor,
Andrew Darby.
