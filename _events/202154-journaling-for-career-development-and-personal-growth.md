Journaling is a great way to tune into your thoughts and emotions, work
through challenges, and support your goals. Research shows that it has
both physical and mental health benefits, including better immune
functioning, decrease in blood pressure, better sleep, decrease in
depression and anxiety, and improved working memory. It can be
particularly helpful in this challenging time of COVID-19. **Please
bring a journal/paper and pen!**

**May Theme: Awe**

We often think about awe in response to rare and intense events, such as
standing at the edge of the Cliffs of Moher. We can also find awe in
everyday events---watching the leaves of a tree change from green to
yellow, seeing a loved one smile or watching the result of an
experiment.

<strong>This month, let's find awe in the simple </strong>**things.**

We will meet on May 4 and 18 at 4 pm.

The Zoom link will be distributed via NIH Trainee Listservs. If you need
the link immediately  or have any questions please email
