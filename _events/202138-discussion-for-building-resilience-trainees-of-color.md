This event is only for NIH Intramural Trainees currently in our postbac,
graduate student, and postdoc programs.  This session will be held
online via Zoom and the link will be distributed in NIH Trainee Listserv
announcements. If you need the link immediately please email
OITE@nih.gov. 

The trainee of color discussion group offers a warm and
welcoming environment for trainees of color to engage in a safe
space. Through the sharing of unique challenges and experiences,
building community, and celebrating difference this group helps trainees
feel connected and supported during their time at NIH. Whether you are
feeling isolated, are unsure, or just want to expand your community,
this group is for you.  This session is open to trainees at all
levels.  

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Jenn
Wiggins. The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential
space to explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and
self-care skills.
