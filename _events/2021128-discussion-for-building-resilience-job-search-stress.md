<span>Networking, career planning and job searches take an enormous
amount of time and energy, with many ups and downs throughout. The
coronavirus pandemic adds layers of difficulty to this process. When
folks are in the process, the focus is often on the search itself rather
than the emotional and psychological stressors. This discussion groups
offers trainees the opportunity to be supported while navigating the
challenges of job searching and developing their stress management and
self-care skills.  Whether you are just beginning to build your network
or in the final negotiations for a new job, it is always a good time to
build resilience and self-care skills that will help you successfully
navigate through periods of transition and change.  </span>

<span>Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Kelly
Donahue. The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential
space to explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and
self-care skills.</span>
