This session will cover the basics of what to look for in a job offer
and how to negotiate the offer (if you even should negotiate).  We will
also cover how to make the transition to your new job easier by planning
ahead.  Topics will include: salary ranges, what to look at in the
benefits package, and surviving your first 90 days.  This session is
appropriate for trainees moving into industry, non-profits, or other
similar positions. 

*Note: This session will NOT cover academic faculty positions, please
see academic specific sessions under the prior events tab of the OITE
Web page.*

*While focused on industry careers, fellows considering careers in
non-profits or government will also find the information presented to be
valuable.*
