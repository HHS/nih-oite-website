When we read or hear about healthy habits our minds gravitate towards
healthy eating habits. By healthy eating habits, most people think about
nutrition, cutting down carbs and calories. This event will focus on how
food nourishes not just our bodies, but our mind and soul,
self-confidence, and our relationships. In this event, trainees can
share stories of sharing, moments of resilience (when they failed to
prepare something and tried again until it came out right), what
motivated them to learn to cook, etc. This event can serve as an
opportunity to self-reflect on positive emotions while acknowledging and
feeling the uncomfortable ones. Cooking can also serve as a journaling
opportunity. In this event, trainees can reflect on how they have been
treating themselves, and what they feel contributes to that.
