*Recent events at the Capitol have brought shock, anger, fear and many
other emotions to most of us.  Added to the other stressors we continue
to face in 2021, we can find ourselves overwhelmed by current events. 
This week\'s Wellness Wednesday will provide a space to process your own
reactions to what has been occurring and provide support to others.  *

**The Zoom link will be distributed via NIH Trainee Listservs. If you
