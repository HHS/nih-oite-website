This event is only for NIH Intramural Trainees currently in our postbac
program.  This session will be held online via Zoom and the link will be
distributed in NIH Trainee Listserv announcements. If you need the link
immediately please email OITE@nih.gov. 

So many of our postbacs are currently studying for and worried about
MCATs, GREs, and other standardized tests coupled with applications and
interviews. The pandemic has also brought many changes to the current
testing and application season. Not only are these changes beyond our
control, but the uncertainty of how they will impact our carefully made
plans for applying to graduate or professional school can be
stressful. This groups allows trainees to discuss with each other how
to build their resilience and self-care skills so that they can
cope effectively during this stressful time and ultimately reach their
career goals.  

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Erin Gates.
The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential space to
explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and self-care
skills.
