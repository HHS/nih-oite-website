Working as a scientist in a non-profit organization combines the passion
for science and the mission to directly contribute to the progress of
society. Although not necessarily obvious, there is a huge diversity of
positions for scientists in non-profit organizations including public
health, science policy, international diplomacy, public relations and
research support and funding. Our panelists will explain their
motivations to transition to the non-profit world, their daily
experience as well as provide advice for the audience.
