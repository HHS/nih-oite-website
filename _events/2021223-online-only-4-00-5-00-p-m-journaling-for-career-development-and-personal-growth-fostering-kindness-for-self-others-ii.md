Journaling is a great way to tune into your thoughts and emotions, work
through challenges, and support your goals. Research shows that it has
both physical and mental health benefits, including better immune
functioning, decrease in blood pressure, better sleep, decrease in
depression and anxiety, and improved working memory. It can be
particularly helpful in this challenging time of COVID-19. This week
will be our second session on the February theme of **\'Fostering
Kindness for Self &amp; Others.\"  Please bring a journal/paper and
pen!  **

**The Zoom link will be distributed via NIH Trainee Listservs. If you
