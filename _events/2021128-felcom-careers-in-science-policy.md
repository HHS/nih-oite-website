Does directing discussion on important science, technology, and national
security issues facing our society interest you?  If so, then this is
the panel to attend!  Science policy touches every facet of our
scientific community:  public and private research funding, academia,
and even foreign policy.  This panel will explore science policy careers
at both government and non-government institutions. With speakers from a
variety of backgrounds, attendees will learn about the diverse
opportunities within this field as well as the entry requirements for
available careers. This event is sponsored by FELCOM\'s Career
Development Subcommittee.
