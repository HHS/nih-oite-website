This session is only for NIH Intramural Trainees.  This online session
will be held with Zoom.  The meeting link will be distributed via the
NIH Trainee Listservs. If you need the link immediately please email
OITE@nih.gov.

Most of us spend more time in our heads or talking to ourselves than we
will ever spend talking with others. Would you say to others, a good
friend for example, the types of things you say to yourself? Using the
principles of self-compassion, we'll examine how the messaging we give
ourselves impacts our feelings, mood, outlook, and success. By holding
more compassion for ourselves, we make room to welcome greater
understanding that is rooted in kindness for us and those around us.
Join our conversation as we explore opportunities to understand what
self-compassion is and how you can put it to work for you! 

Please join us for an online discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor,
Fabian Drain.  The discussion group provides a welcoming and
confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways to build
resilience and self-care skills. Even if you can\'t join us for the
entire hour, we encourage you to still attend.
