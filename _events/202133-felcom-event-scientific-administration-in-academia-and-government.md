With the advancement of science and increased research complexity, a
large number of highly trained professionals are needed  to support
different aspects of the scientific enterprise. These positions are
often occupied by scientists having PhDs and they are required to have a
deep understanding of science along with specific skill sets. To explore
the diversity of this field, the career development subcommittee have
gathered a panel composed of speakers working in grants administration,
training offices, and more. The panelists will share their experience
and tell us how they transitioned into their present roles. They will
also  be available for a question answer session. Come and join us to
learn more about those fascinating careers and get tips for making
successful career transition!
