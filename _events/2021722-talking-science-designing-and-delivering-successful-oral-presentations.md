Science isn\'t complete until the results have been shared with
interested others, and talking about your results is one of the
important ways of making them public. This presentation will address
topics including the anatomy of a science talk, creating successful
slides, delivering your content convincingly, ensuring that your talk is
well-received, and answering questions. The information will help you
with presentations in group meetings, presenting findings at conferences
and meetings, and delivering scientific talks to a wide variety of
audiences.
