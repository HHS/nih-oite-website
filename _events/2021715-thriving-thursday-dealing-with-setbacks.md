This event is only for NIH Intramural Trainees currently in our postbac,
graduate student, and postdoc programs.  This session will be held
online via Zoom and the link will be distributed in NIH Trainee Listserv
announcements. If you need the link immediately please email
OITE@nih.gov. 

Many of us set goals for ourselves, personally and professionally, with
the best of intentions to follow through. But what we often forget to
plan for is the inevitable setbacks we will face when trying to achieve
these goals. Join us this Thriving Thursday as we talk about effective
ways to plan for, manage, and move through the frustrating setbacks that
often get in the way of us making the changes we desire.  

This group will be facilitated by OITE Wellness Advisor Sara Hunter.
