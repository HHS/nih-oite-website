There is compelling research to show that exercise positively impacts
symptoms of depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and stress. Though we
often take more cognitive approaches to managing stress and achieving
greater mental health, we sometimes forget about the clear link between
the mind and the body and the important impact this connection has on
our well-being. Purposeful movement can help us get at problems from a
different, more bottom-up approach through the release of critical
neurotransmitters that positively change our mood and functioning.  Join
us this Thriving Thursday as we talk about the power of movement in
shaping our well-being and how we can begin to incorporate regular
movement in our lives to experience its impacts, both physically and
mentally. The link for this event will be provided in the OITE morning
mailing.
