The summer is almost here and this year our influx of summer students
will happen virtually. With this, comes the responsibility to mentor
these enthusiastic young scientists effectively, specially in a remote
setting. Though mentoring can be a very rewarding experience, it also
has its challenges. Are you wondering: How to handle your expectations?
How to design a manageable virtual summer project for a novice? How to
mentor and engage virtually a student with little or no research
experience? If so, please join us for 2021 Summer Research Mentor
Training. This workshop will provide you with tools and resources to
help you set your students up for success, during this unique,
challenging summer experience. We will discuss how to set expectations,
provide feedback, set boundaries and assess student learning while
completing a remote virtual project.

NOTE: There will be two webinars: May 19th and May 21st from 1:00 pm -
3:00 pm. These are identical sessions and you only need to attend one.
Zoom link will be sent to registrants closer to the event date.
