Words have power. The way we talk to ourselves and others can shape
relationships, experiences and perspectives. Words can be used to engage
in negative self-talk or be our biggest cheerleader. Words can also be
used to effectively communicate our needs and boundaries. Â This Thriving
Thursday we will explore how to be well ways to give power to more
positive language to promote stress tolerance.
