Journaling is a great way to tune into your thoughts and emotions, work
through challenges, and support your goals. Research shows that it has
both physical and mental health benefits, including better immune
functioning, decrease in blood pressure, better sleep, decrease in
depression and anxiety, and improved working memory. It can be
particularly helpful in this challenging time of COVID-19. **Please
bring a journal/paper and pen!  **{::}**January Theme: \"Your Best
