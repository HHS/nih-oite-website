Research has shown many positive effects of mindfulness meditation,
including better sleep and immune functioning, increased attention and
ability to focus, lowered effects of stress, and enhanced ability to
regulate emotions.  OITE's 30-minute guided meditation sessions are
offered to provide space and time for participants to experience these
benefits.  No special clothing or equipment is required, and
participants can attend whenever it fits their schedule.  Please join us
on Mondays at 12:00 noon, Tuesdays at 5:00 p.m., and Thursdays at 5:00
p.m.  The Zoom link will be distributed via trainees list serves.
