It is common for scientists to present their research findings to peers
at scientific poster sessions. This workshop will help prepare you for
Poster Day or any other opportunity you have to present your work in
virtual poster format. The workshop will focus on selecting and
organizing data, the key sections of a successful poster, layout and
font selection, and poster presentation techniques.

NOTE: Graduate students and Postdocs are also welcome.
