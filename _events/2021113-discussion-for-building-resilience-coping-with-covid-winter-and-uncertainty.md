<span>Winter is here.  The colder weather,
shorter days, and social distancing will begin to present us with new
challenges for our wellness. Additionally, the persistent feelings of
uncertainty about the future continue to trouble many of us. Just
as we were beginning to develop some semblance of a routine and learning
to cope with this uncertainty, a COVID winter may disrupt them again.
This discussion will focus on how to reevaluate coping tools for the
winter and continued uncertainty.   </span>

<span>Please join us for a discussion with OITE
Wellness Advisor,Liann Seiter. The discussion group provides a welcoming
and confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways to build
resilience and self-care skills.</span>
