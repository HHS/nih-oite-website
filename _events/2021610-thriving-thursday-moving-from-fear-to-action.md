In moments of high stress, it can be difficult to not be overwhelmed by
fear -- fear of failure, of not getting something just right, of not
measuring up. It is an emotion we all feel, but when we let it take the
lead in our lives and at work it can be paralyzing, overriding our
better judgment and ability to engage effectively with the world around
us. Join us this Thriving Thursday as we talk about mechanisms of our
fear response, what to do with it, and most importantly, how to move
from patterns of paralysis or over-extending ourselves in response to
this fear to more effective and purposeful action.
