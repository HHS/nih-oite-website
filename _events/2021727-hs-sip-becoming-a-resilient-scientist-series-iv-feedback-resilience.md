We all need feedback to grow and learn but we often become defensive and
are unable to learn from the feedback we receive, even if it is
delivered well. In this webinar, we will talk about why receiving
feedback is so difficult and explore ways to stay calm and engaged when
receiving feedback. We will also talk about giving feedback in a calm
and assertive way so that our voice can be heard.

## BECOMING A RESILIENT SCIENTIST SERIES (4 WEEKS)

Navigating school, the career exploration process, research
environments, and the stress of national/international news can seem
overwhelming and lead us to doubt ourselves just when we need confidence
the most. Through workshops and group discussions in this series, we
will work to identify attitudes and behaviors that can help us be more
resilient as we navigate difficult situations in school, work and life.
Each workshop will highlight emotional intelligence competencies needed
for success in research and healthcare careers and will provide
strategies for developing these competencies as part of your educational
journey. While you may participate in any of webinars, it is best to
participate in the entire series as the material relates and concepts
will be developed throughout the series. We will offer this series on
Tuesdays (with a related small group discussion on Thursday) twice in
summer 2021, once for students in college and above (June 8-29) and once
for high school students and recent high school graduates (July 8-27).
Each series will consist of four workshops and four small group
discussions:
