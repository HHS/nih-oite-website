<span>Habits are hard to break.  Are you tired of your unhealthy habits
bringing you down?  Some of these unhealthy habits could include
excessive cellphone use, indulging in comfort foods, or constantly
thinking about work after work hours. Come to a safe space where habit
building and modifying is the shared challenge and focus point.  Using
research on habit change, along with some compassionate support, you can
gain the tools you need to develop a happier and healthier you and
thrive in our new version of normal. </span>

<span>Please join us for an online discussion with OITE Wellness
Advisor, Marin Rieger.   Building your resiliency and self-care skills
now will help you to successfully navigate through periods of growth,
and will serve you well throughout your academic and career path.  Even
if you can't join us for the entire hour, we encourage you to still
attend.  </span>
