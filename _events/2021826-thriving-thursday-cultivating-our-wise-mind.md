Emotional intelligence is our ability to discern our own emotional
states as well as others and then use that information to guide or
behaviors and decision making. Wise Mind -- the integration of the
wisdom of our emotions and practicality of our logic - is a tool we can
use to cultivate our emotional intelligence in effort to navigate the
nuances of our work and daily life more effectively.  Join us this
Thriving Thursday as we learn about using Wise Mind to increase our
emotional intelligence as we work towards optimizing our well-being.
