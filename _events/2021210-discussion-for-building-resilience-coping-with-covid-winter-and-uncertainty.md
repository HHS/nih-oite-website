<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Winter is
here.  The colder weather, shorter days, and social distancing will
begin to present us with new challenges for our wellness. Additionally,
the persistent feelings of uncertainty about the future continue
to trouble many of us. Just as we were beginning to develop some
semblance of a routine and learning to cope with this uncertainty, a
COVID winter may disrupt them again. This discussion will focus on how
to reevaluate coping tools for the winter and continued
uncertainty.   </span>

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Please join us
for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Liann Seiter. The
discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential space to explore
positive and proactive ways to build resilience and self-care
skills.</span>
