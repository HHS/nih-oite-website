We all have patterns of thinking that are unhelpful and
sometimes distorted, which often become our habitual way of interacting
with the world. These false beliefs are usually self-limiting and
self-defeating and can negatively impact us both professionally and
personally. At times, these thoughts cause many of us to feel less
confident and knowledgeable than we really are - - so we feel like an
imposter or that we do not belong. Let's talk about how to recognize
these negative patterns and thoughts, and make positive changes.  This
session will help you to explore strategies for facing and minimizing
negative thoughts, identifying positive qualities, and communicating in
a more assertive and confident manner.   

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Fabian
Drain. The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential space
to explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and self-care
skills.
