One of the joys of the summer is when the summer interns get to interact
with our current trainees. To help make this happen, the OITE has
planned some fun casual virtual activities where we will gather for an
activity and break into small groups to virtually mingle. We hope you
will find some time to join us!

\*Note: The Zoom link will be distributed via NIH Trainee Listservs. If
you need the link immediately or have any questions please send us an
email at [oite@mail.nih.gov](mailto:oite@mail.nih.gov) .

 

**LAUGHTER YOGA**

FRIDAY JUNE 25, 2021, 3:30 - 4:30 Eastern Time

Explore the power of laughter by joining our science-themed laughter
yoga session. We will learn a bit about the science behind laughter
yoga, get a chance to practice together and have some fun chatting with
other interns and current NIH trainees. If you have never tried laughter
yoga, I promise that you will be smiling by the time we are done.
Everyone who attends will receive a raffle ticket with the chance of
winning some great prizes.
