<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Mental health
conditions like anxiety, depression, OCD, ADHD/ADD,
ASD sometimes occur as natural systems become dysregulated and they can
often exacerbate each other. While experiencing the effects of anxiety
and depression may be overwhelming, there are ways to manage and work
with these feelings. Come share your thoughts and learn from each
other's experiences in dealing with anxiety, depression, and other
challenges. </span>

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Please join us
for an online discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Kelly Donahue.  The
discussion group provides a confidential and welcoming space to explore
positive and proactive methods to build resilience and self-care skills
with other trainees having similar experiences.  Even if you can\'t join
us for the entire hour, we encourage you to still attend.  </span>
