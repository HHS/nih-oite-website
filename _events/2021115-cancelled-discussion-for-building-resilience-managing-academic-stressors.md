<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This event conflicts with the NIH Town
Hall and has been canceled.  </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">So many of our postbacs are currently
studying for and worried about MCATs, GREs, and other standardized tests
coupled with applications and interviews. The pandemic has also brought
many changes to the current testing and application season. Not only are
these changes beyond our control, but the uncertainty of how they will
impact our carefully made plans for applying to graduate or professional
school can be stressful. This groups allows trainees to discuss with
each other how to build their resilience and self-care skills so
that they can cope effectively during this stressful time and ultimately
reach their career goals.  </span>
