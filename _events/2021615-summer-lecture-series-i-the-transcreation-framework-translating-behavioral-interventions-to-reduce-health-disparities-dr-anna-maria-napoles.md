**Title: **The Transcreation Framework: Translating Behavioral
Interventions to Reduce Health Disparities

Dr. Anna Maria Napoles will describe her career path to becoming
Scientific Director of the National Institute on Minority Health and
Health Disparities. She will discuss an innovative implementation
framework that she developed with colleague, Dr. Anita Stewart, to
create a step-by-step process for planning, delivering, and evaluating
behavioral interventions so that they resonate with and engage the
communities experiencing the disparities, while achieving the intended
health outcomes.
