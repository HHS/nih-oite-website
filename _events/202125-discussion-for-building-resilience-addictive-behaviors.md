<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:

shift in our day to day lives, isolation from whom and what we love, and
fear about the future, we are likely to rely on habits even more than
usual.  If you are struggling to make sense of your own addictive
behaviors, this internal fight may be particularly challenging while
physically distancing from others. Using research on habit change, along
with some compassionate support, you can gain the tools you need to
develop a happier and healthier you and thrive in our new version of
normal. </span>

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:

Advisor, Marin Rieger.   Building your resiliency and self-care skills
now will help you to successfully navigate through periods of growth,
and will serve you well throughout your academic and career path.  Even
if you can't join us for the entire hour, we encourage you to still
attend.  </span>
