This event is only for NIH Intramural Trainees currently in our graduate
student programs.  This session will be held online via Zoom and the
link will be distributed in NIH Trainee Listserv announcements. If you
need the link immediately please email OITE@nih.gov. 

Pursuing a graduate degree is a challenging and rewarding endeavor of
its own, but it often takes place during periods of rapid growth both
personally and professionally. With so many things to juggle in graduate
school it can be easy to feel overwhelmed and sometimes disconnected
especially if there are unresolved interpersonal issues. Recent events
have also increased levels of uncertainty with the added challenge of
being physically distant from mentors, mentees, lab mates, friends, and
family. Join us for a chance to discuss the unique challenges you face
as graduate students and to learn how to manage them by talking to each
other. 

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Annie
Scheiner. The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential
space to explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and
self-care skills.
