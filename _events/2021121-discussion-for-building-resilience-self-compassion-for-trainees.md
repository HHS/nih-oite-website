<span>This session is only for NIH Intramural Trainees.  This online
session will be held with Zoom.  The meeting link will be distributed
via the NIH Trainee Listservs. If you need the link immediately please
email OITE@nih.gov.</span>

<span>Most of us spend more time in our heads or talking to ourselves
than we will ever spend talking with others. Would you say to others, a
good friend for example, the types of things you say to yourself? Using
the principles of self-compassion, we'll examine how the messaging we
give ourselves impacts our feelings, mood, outlook, and success. By
holding more compassion for ourselves, we make room to welcome greater
understanding that is rooted in kindness for us and those around us.
Join our conversation as we explore opportunities to understand what
self-compassion is and how you can put it to work for you! </span>

<span>Please join us for an online discussion with OITE Wellness
Advisor, Lissa Mantell.  The discussion group provides a welcoming and
confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways to build
resilience and self-care skills. Even if you can\'t join us for the
entire hour, we encourage you to still attend.  </span>
