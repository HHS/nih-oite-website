Postbac Poster Day provides an opportunity for Postbacs to share the
research they have been conducting at the NIH and at the same time
develop their communication and networking skills. Posters will be
reviewed by teams composed of graduate students, postdocs, and staff
scientists. The authors of the top 20% will receive a letter
acknowledging their accomplishments. For more information,

If you want to participate in Postbac Poster Day you must sign up in
