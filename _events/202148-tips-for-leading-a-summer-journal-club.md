Soon the summer interns will join the NIH -- this year remotely! This
provides you the opportunity to lead a summer journal club around your
favorite biomedical topic. This webinar offers tips on managing an
online summer journal club, from selecting the right articles, guiding a
discussion, and navigating the logistics.

Note: For those wishing to lead a Summer Intern Journal Club, this is a
mandatory event.

This event will be held on zoom. You will receive the link to the
session the day of the event.
