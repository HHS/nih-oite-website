<span>**NOTE: This workshop is part of
Virtual Summer Enrichment Curriculum; the target audience is NIH summer
interns and students outside NIH. NIH Postbacs, Graduate students, and
postdocs will NOT receive credit for this course.**</span>

<span>Research Ethics is at the foundation
of everything we do in the scientific endeavor, and training in
Responsible Conduct of Research is an essential component of your
development as a scientist as you train here at the NIH. The news is
full of reports about scientific misconduct and its profound
consequences. OITE is offering this course specifically for summer
students to ensure that you have the foundation and information to
conduct rigorous and ethical research during your time here and
beyond.</span>

This course will use lectures, group discussions, and case studies to
explore the principles of research ethics.
