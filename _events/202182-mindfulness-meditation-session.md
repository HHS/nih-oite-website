This event is only for NIH Intramural Trainees currently in our postbac,
graduate student, and postdoc programs.  This session will be held
online via Zoom and the link will be distributed in NIH Trainee Listserv
announcements. If you need the link immediately please email

Research has shown many positive effects of mindfulness meditation,
including better sleep and immune functioning, increased attention and
ability to focus, lowered effects of stress, and enhanced ability to
regulate emotions.  OITE's 30-minute guided meditation sessions are
offered to provide space and time for participants to experience these
benefits.  No special clothing or equipment is required, and
participants can attend whenever it fits their schedule.
