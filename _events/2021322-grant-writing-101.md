Understanding Grant Writing and Writing a Grant Application. Topics will
include finding funding opportunities (including NIH training and career
awards), understanding the NIH grant process, and an insight into the
peer-review process. Next, we will help you understand how to write a
competitive grant application including a discussion of the major
components of research, training and career development grants.  Topics
include strategies for writing grants, developing your specific aims and
responding to grant reviews.

This workshop is intended to provide the background fellows need to
begin crafting a grant application; it does not involve written
assignments or feedback on drafts of applications.

This session will be virtual. Log in information will be shared with
registrants.
