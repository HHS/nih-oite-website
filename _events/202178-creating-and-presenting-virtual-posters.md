It is common for scientists to present their research findings to peers
at scientific poster sessions. This workshop will help prepare you for
Summer Presentation Week or any other opportunity you have to present
your work in virtual poster format. The workshop will focus on selecting
and organizing data, the key sections of a successful poster, layout and
font selection, and poster presentation techniques.

NOTE: Graduate students and Postdocs are also welcome.
