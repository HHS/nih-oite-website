<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This event is only for NIH Intramural
Trainees currently in our postbac, graduate student, and postdoc
programs.  This session will be held online via Zoom and the link will
be distributed in NIH Trainee Listserv announcements. If you need the
link immediately please email OITE@nih.gov. </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">International trainees often face a
unique set of challenges. Whether it is the distance from family and
home, learning a new culture, visa stress, or discovering a new sense of
community, these challenges can cause fellows to feel overwhelmed,
anxious, or lonely. This supportive space is meant to remind trainees
that they are not alone in dealing with these issues and that there
are other trainees having similar experiences.  Additionally, the
group offers space to dialogue around U.S. culture, coping tools and to
learn from each other. </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please join us for a discussion with OITE
Wellness Advisor, Emilie Gomart. The discussion group provides a
welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways
to build resilience and self-care skills.</span>
