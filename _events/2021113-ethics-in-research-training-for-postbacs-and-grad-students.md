<span>Training in
Responsible Conduct of Research is an essential component of your
development as a scientist.</span>

The news is full of reports about scientific misconduct and its profound
consequences. The NIH has created a course specifically for postbacs and
grad students to ensure that you have the foundation and information to
conduct rigorous and ethical research during your time here and beyond.

This course will use lectures, group discussions, and case studies to
explore the principles of research ethics. The full-day course is split
into a morning and afternoon session (attendance at both is required for
course credit.) Each class accommodates 70 people. Certificates will be
awarded to those that complete the course.

Topics to be covered include:

* Overview of research ethics (current topics and historical studies)
* Formal research misconduct (falsification, fabrication, and
  plagiarism)
* Ethical research involving animal models and human subjects
* Data management
* Mentor/mentee relations
* Conflict of Interest
* Conflict resolution and reporting
* Strategies for excelling as a trainee in an ethical manner

**\*This course is only for postbacs and grad students.  Note: If you
took this course at NIH last year, you do not need to take it again.**
