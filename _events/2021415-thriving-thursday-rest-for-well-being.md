** **Despite our body and mind's best efforts to signal to us to
slowdown and reset, we continue to put in the long hours at work and
fend off the endless list of symptoms from our sleepless nights. For
many, we've been conditioned to think there is weakness in rest and that
there is an opportunity cost in it that's not worth paying. But we're
hardwired for rest, and without it, our work, relationships, and mental
health ultimately suffer. Join us this Thriving Thursday to talk about
ways to schedule in guilt-free rest that can lead to more productive and
enjoyable work and ultimately greater wellness. The link for this event
will be provided in the OITE morning mailing.
