This event is only for NIH Intramural Trainees currently in our postbac,
graduate student, and postdoc programs.  This session will be held
online via Zoom and the link will be distributed in NIH Trainee Listserv
announcements. If you need the link immediately please email
OITE@nih.gov. 

Please join this warm and welcoming group of LGBTQI+ trainees to enjoy a
safe space and be yourself. Let's share our unique resources,
experiences and challenges to help you feel connected and supported
during your time as an NIH trainee. Whether you are feeling isolated,
unsure or just want to expand your community, this LGBTQI+ group is for
you.  Labels are less important than your feeling connected to our
community; come join us wherever you are on your own personal
journey.  This session is open to trainees at all levels (postbac, grad,
and postdoc).

Please join us for an online discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor,
Andrew Darby.  The discussion group provides a welcoming and
confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways to build
resilience and self-care skills. Even if you can\'t join us for the
entire hour, we encourage you to still attend.
