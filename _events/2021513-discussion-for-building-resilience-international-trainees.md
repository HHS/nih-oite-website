This event is only for NIH Intramural Trainees currently in our postbac,
graduate student, and postdoc programs.  This session will be held
online via Zoom and the link will be distributed in NIH Trainee Listserv
announcements. If you need the link immediately please email
OITE@nih.gov. 

International trainees often face a unique set of challenges. Whether it
is the distance from family and home, learning a new culture, visa
stress, or discovering a new sense of community, these challenges can
cause fellows to feel overwhelmed, anxious, or lonely. This supportive
space is meant to remind trainees that they are not alone in dealing
with these issues and that there
are other trainees having similar experiences.  Additionally, the
group offers space to dialogue around U.S. culture, coping tools and to
learn from each other. 

Please join us for a discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Sara Hunter.
The discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential space to
explore positive and proactive ways to build resilience and self-care
skills.
