In the field of biomedical research, we sometimes fall into the trap of
idealizing our perfectionistic tendencies, convincing ourselves that
it's the reason we've made it this far and is critical to us being
successful in the future. Unfortunately, these unsustainable behaviors
and unrealistic thought patterns end up perpetuating anxiety, unhelpful
comparisons, and isolation which negatively impacts our work and overall
well-being. Join us this Thriving Thursday as we talk
about *why* Healthy Striving is a better alternative to this
perfectionistic trap and *how *we can achieve it through tangible
strategies that will impact our work, relationships, and sense of
self. The link for this event will be provided in the OITE morning
mailing.
