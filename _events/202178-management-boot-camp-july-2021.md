Management of people and resources is a key component to being
successful as you move forward in your career.  The OITE has developed
an intense course to give advanced postdocs and fellows an overview of
common management concepts that are not often taught in a lab
environment.  The topics covered will be applicable to all sectors
(academics, industry, non-profits, government, etc.).

This course requires a commitment of multiple days. Directions for
applying to the course are below.
