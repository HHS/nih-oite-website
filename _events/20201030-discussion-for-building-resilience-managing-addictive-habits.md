This event is only for NIH Intramural Trainees currently in our postbac,

Habits are hard to break.  And when we are faced with a monumental shift
in our day to day lives, isolation from whom and what we love, and fear
about the future, we are likely to rely on habits even more than usual. 
If you are struggling to make sense of your own addictive behaviors,
this internal fight may be particularly challenging while physically
distancing from others.  Being secluded from coworkers, friends, and
family members, is likely to create a sense of loneliness.  When we feel
lonely, this can create negative feelings that we may be tempted to
numb.   Using research on habit change, along with some compassionate
support, you can gain the tools you need to develop a happier and
healthier you and thrive in our new version of normal.

Please join us for an online discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor,
Marin Rieger.   Building your resiliency and self-care skills now will
help you to successfully navigate through periods of growth, and will
serve you well throughout your academic and career path.  Even if you
can't join us for the entire hour, we encourage you to still attend.
