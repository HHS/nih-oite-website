One of the joys of the summer is when the summer interns get to interact
with our current trainees. To help make this happen, the OITE has
planned some fun casual virtual activities where we will gather for an
activity and break into small groups to virtually mingle. We hope you
will find some time to join us!

\*Note: The Zoom link will be distributed via NIH Trainee Listservs. If
you need the link immediately or have any questions please send us an
email at [oite@mail.nih.gov](mailto:oite@mail.nih.gov) .
