This event is only for NIH Intramural Trainees currently in our postbac,
graduate student, and postdoc programs.  This session will be held
online via Zoom and the link will be distributed in NIH Trainee Listserv
announcements. If you need the link immediately please email
OITE@nih.gov. 

As Dr. Milgram says, "In order to do well, we have to be well." But what
does this really mean? Often people think about this as being free from
injuring or illness, but being well entails so much more. It encompasses
several, intersecting dimensions of ourselves, all of which need to be
attended to for us to optimize our well-being. Join us this Thriving
Thursday as we discuss the multiple dimensions of wellness and the ways
we can continue to move closer to "being well" so that, among many
things, we can "do well". This group will be facilitated by OITE
Wellness Advisor Sara Hunter.
