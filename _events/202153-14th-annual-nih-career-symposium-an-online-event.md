In 2021- the Career Symposium will be virtual. It will run from May 3 to
May 7. The NIH Career Symposium highlights the diversity of career
choices available to *your* generation of biomedical researchers. 
Whether you are a new graduate student, postdoc, or clinical fellow just
beginning to consider career options or a senior student/fellow ready to
look for a job, the NIH Career Symposium is for you. Wondering what the
Career Symposium is all about?  [View the 2020 Virtual Career Symposium
YouTube playlist][1].

<em><strong>REGISTRATION IS FULL. </strong></em>

***[Program][2]: schedule and speakers  
***

In 2021 the focus is on networking opportunities. We will host a series
of "rooms" for career conversations slots with one or two speakers in a
45-minute time slot. Multiple rooms with speakers in similar career
paths will run concurrently. For example, research positions in industry
would have multiple rooms going at once. Our goal is that each room will
have no more than 15 participants, giving every attendee ample time to
connect with a professional. Participants will have the ability to move
through the "rooms" as they like, meeting a speaker, asking questions,
or even just listening in to see if a particular career path looks
enticing. NOTE: What is said in these rooms will NOT be recorded.

If you would like to explore these career options on your own schedule,
we have a plethora of panels, interviews and written synopses of
previous events. Check out past events [here][3].

*We invite any postdoc, clinical fellow, or PhD-level graduate student
to join us. You need not be at the NIH to participate. This event is
free to attend. *

Trainees in the NIH Intramural Research Program will be able to register
for the conversations of their choice starting April 1. Any other
trainee interested in attending will be able to register starting April
15. (*updated 4/13/2021*)
