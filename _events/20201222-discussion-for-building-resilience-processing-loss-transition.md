<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Grief comes in many forms and the process
of grieving is uniquely individual, but regardless of where you are
in your process we can talk about ways to move forward. The current
state of the pandemic has led to widespread feelings of loss and
uncertainty which has the ability to compound our other feelings of
grief and loss.. In this group, we can talk about the experience
of loss, significant change, and/or transition. Being mindful of our
feelings is one way to start processing grief, but we call also share
other strategies and brainstorm together.  </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please join us for a discussion with OITE
Wellness Advisor, Annie Scheiner. The discussion group provides a
welcoming and confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways
to build resilience and self-care skills.</span>
