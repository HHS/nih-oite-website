Â We spend much of the day engaged in or thinking about our work. The
environment in which we work and the relationships that we maintain play
a major role in our productivity. There are times when these workplace
dynamics can be difficult and can impact our professional wellness. Join
us this Thriving Thursday to explore tools to foster healthy workplace
dynamics. This group will be facilitated by OITE Wellness Advisor, Jenn
Wiggins.
