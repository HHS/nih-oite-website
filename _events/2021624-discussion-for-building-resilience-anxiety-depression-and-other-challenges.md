This event is only for NIH Intramural Trainees currently in our postbac,
graduate student, and postdoc programs.  This session will be held
online via Zoom and the link will be distributed in NIH Trainee Listserv
announcements. If you need the link immediately please email
OITE@nih.gov. 

Mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, OCD, ADHD/ADD,
ASD sometimes occur as natural systems become dysregulated and they can
often exacerbate each other. While experiencing the effects of anxiety
and depression may be overwhelming, there are ways to manage and work
with these feelings. Come share your thoughts and learn from each
other's experiences in dealing with anxiety, depression, and other
challenges. 

Please join us for an online discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor,
Kelly Donahue.  The discussion group provides a confidential and
welcoming space to explore positive and proactive methods to build
resilience and self-care skills with other trainees having similar
experiences.  Even if you can\'t join us for the entire hour, we
encourage you to still attend.
