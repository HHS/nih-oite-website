OITE will provide a virtual mandatory training for all trainees (IRTAs,
CRTAs, and Visiting Fellows) regarding your rights and responsibilities
as a trainee, especially around new policies at the NIH. The goal of
this training is to provide you with information to ensure that you are
safe while at the NIH, and ensure that you are aware of the policies and
resources to set yourself up for both personal and career success. 

If you have successfully completed this training in the past, you do not
need to attend again. If you are new to the NIH and have not completed
this training, now is the time to do so.  This training is offered every
other month.
