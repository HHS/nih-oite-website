The NIH Office of Intramural Training and Education (OITE) and the NIH
Science and Technology Research Infrastructure for Discovery,
Experimentation, and Sustainability (STRIDES) Initiative have partnered
to bring the NIH summer interns a half day event that will expose
attendees to a variety of cloud computing concepts and use cases for
biomedical research.

The day begins with a keynote address from NIH's Chief Information
Officer and Director of the NIH Center for Information Technology,
Andrea Norris. Industry experts will then lead workshops in both Amazon
Web Services (AWS) and the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which should
provide students an opportunity to learn how these critical platforms
work and how they enable the exciting research that NIH conducts. To
conclude the day, NIH researchers will present on a variety of topics in
a "lightning round" session highlighting different research
applications, workflow, and opportunities that cloud presents.
