<span style="font-size: 10pt;">This event is only for NIH Intramural
Trainees currently in our postbac program.  This session will be held

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">So many of our postbacs are currently
studying for and worried about MCATs, GREs, and other standardized tests
coupled with applications and interviews. The pandemic has also brought
many changes to the current testing and application season. Not only are
these changes beyond our control, but the uncertainty of how they will
impact our carefully made plans for applying to graduate or professional
school can be stressful. This groups allows trainees to discuss with
each other how to build their resilience and self-care skills so
that they can cope effectively during this stressful time and ultimately
reach their career goals.  </span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please join us for a discussion with OITE
Wellness Advisor, Erin Gates. The discussion group provides a welcoming
and confidential space to explore positive and proactive ways to build
resilience and self-care skills.</span>
