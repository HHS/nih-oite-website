We all need to develop the skills needed to be assertive and to advocate
for ourselves, especially in hierarchical environments where we
sometimes feel we do not have a voice. In this webinar, we will discuss
how to set boundaries, communicate expectations, ask for feedback and
discuss difficult issues with friends, mentors, colleagues and
supervisors.

## BECOMING A RESILIENT SCIENTIST SERIES (4 WEEKS)

Navigating school, the career exploration process, research
environments, and the stress of national/international news can seem
overwhelming and lead us to doubt ourselves just when we need confidence
the most. Through workshops and group discussions in this series, we
will work to identify attitudes and behaviors that can help us be more
resilient as we navigate difficult situations in school, work and life.
Each workshop will highlight emotional intelligence competencies needed
for success in research and healthcare careers and will provide
strategies for developing these competencies as part of your educational
journey. While you may participate in any of webinars, it is best to
participate in the entire series as the material relates and concepts
will be developed throughout the series. We will offer this series on
Tuesdays (with a related small group discussion on Thursday) twice in
summer 2021, once for students in college and above (June 8-29) and once
for high school students and recent high school graduates (July 8-27).
Each series will consist of four workshops and four small group
discussions:
