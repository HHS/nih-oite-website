<span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif; color:
black;">During these virtual Q&amp;A sessions the pre-medical team will
answer questions about the medical school application, AMCAS and MCAT
updates, and other general questions. We are going to be meeting every
other week. These sessions are not consecutive, so you can attend one or
more, and as many as you want. </span>
