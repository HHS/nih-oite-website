This event is only for NIH Intramural Trainees currently in our postbac,
graduate student, and postdoc programs.  This session will be held
online via Zoom and the link will be distributed in NIH Trainee Listserv
announcements. If you need the link immediately please email
OITE@nih.gov. 

The "3 P's" -- Personalization, Permanence, and Pervasiveness --
describe the ways in which we see and relate to the world around us.
Join us this Thriving Thursday as we discuss how these 3 P's can shift
our perspective when we encounter difficult situations and increase our
ability to deal with stress more effectively. This group will be
facilitated by OITE Wellness Advisor Sara Hunter.
