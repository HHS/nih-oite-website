This workshop is geared towards NIH trainees interested in building a
project on the *[All of Us Researcher Workbench][1]* platform. This
90-minute workshop will feature a Workbench demonstration, a
presentation from a current Workbench user, and an opportunity for
discussion on how trainees can leverage<em> All of Us</em> data and
tools to power their studies. We encourage all trainees to begin
registration for the Researcher Workbench prior to this session.
