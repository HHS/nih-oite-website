postbac, graduate student, and postdoc programs.  This session will be

Listserv announcements. If you need the link immediately please email

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:

enjoy a safe space and be yourself. Let's share our unique resources,
experiences and challenges to help you feel connected and supported
during your time as an NIH trainee. Whether you are feeling isolated,
unsure or just want to expand your community, this LGBTQIA+ group is for
you.  Labels are less important than your feeling connected to our
community; come join us wherever you are on your own personal journey.
This session is open to trainees at all levels (postbac, grad, and
postdoc).</span>

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Please join us
for an online discussion with OITE Wellness Advisor, Lissa Mantell.  The
discussion group provides a welcoming and confidential space to explore
positive and proactive ways to build resilience and self-care skills.
Even if you can\'t join us for the entire hour, we encourage you to
still attend. </span>
