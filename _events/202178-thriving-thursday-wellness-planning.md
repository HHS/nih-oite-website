Wellness is not merely the absence of illness or distress.  It involves
working toward positive, holistic health and wellbeing.  And in today\'s
world, this is a lifelong process of making decisions that support a
more balanced life and enable you to maximize your potential.  The first
step is to get a realistic picture of how you\'re doing now.  Then based
on this picture, the next step is to create a workable self-care plan. 
During this week\'s \"Wellness Wednesday\" we will talk about the
meaning of holistic health, take a Self-Care Assessment, and begin
mapping out a Self-Care Plan.  Come join us to get started on supporting
a healthier you!
