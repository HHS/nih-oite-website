<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Grief comes in
many forms and the process of grieving is uniquely individual, but
regardless of where you are in your process we can talk about ways to
move forward. The current state of the pandemic
has led to widespread feelings of loss and uncertainty which has
the ability to compound our other feelings of grief and loss.. In this
group, we can talk about the experience of loss, significant change,
and/or transition. Being mindful of our feelings is one way to start
processing grief, but we call also share other strategies and brainstorm
together.  </span>
