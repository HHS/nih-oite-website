programs.  This session will be held online via Zoom and the link will

<span>Mental health conditions like anxiety,
depression, OCD, ADHD/ADD, ASD sometimes occur as natural systems become
dysregulated and they can often exacerbate each other. While
experiencing the effects of anxiety and depression
may be overwhelming, there are ways to manage and work with these
feelings. Come share your thoughts and learn from each
other's experiences in dealing with anxiety, depression, and other
challenges. </span>

<span>Please join us for an online discussion
with OITE Wellness Advisor, Annie Scheiner.  The discussion group
provides a confidential and welcoming space to explore positive and
proactive methods to build resilience and self-care skills with other
trainees having similar experiences.  Even if you can\'t join us for the
entire hour, we encourage you to still attend.  </span>
