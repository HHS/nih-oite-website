Do you notice procrastination showing up repeatedly despite all your
best efforts to fix this nagging problem? Don't worry. You're not alone.
Many of us struggle with procrastination, repeating unhelpful patterns
of putting off work until tomorrow or waiting until the last minute to
complete tasks. This not only impacts our productivity and quality of
work but also our well-being. Join us this Thriving Thursday as we
discuss the many reasons we fall back on procrastination and what skills
we can use to interrupt this pattern to engage with our work and life
differently.  

This group will be facilitated by OITE Wellness Advisor Sara Hunter.
