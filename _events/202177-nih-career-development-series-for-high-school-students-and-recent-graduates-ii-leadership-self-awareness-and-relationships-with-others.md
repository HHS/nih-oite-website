We each bring our unique personalities and work styles to the classroom,
lab, workplace, and home. Understanding your style and appreciating that
others have different styles can enhance your interactions and help you
succeed. This workshop will explore differences in personalities and
work styles that impact the way we communicate, take in information,
make decisions, engage in conflict, learn, and plan our day. The
workshop will include group activities and hands-on experiences related
to working successfully in educational and research team environments.

Note: Students who attend at least four workshops will be eligible to
receive a certificate of completion.
