During these virtual Q&amp;A sessions the career counseling team will
answer questions about Resumes, CVs, and Cover Letters.

This is not a workshop, but a chance for you to drop-in and get your
questions answered. Show up at the beginning of the session, submit your
questions via the chat function, and we will take questions in order of
submission.

Before attending: You should attend the session on 3/1 or view the
recent recording on the OITE YouTube page. https://youtu.be/zvEqu8HBpS8
