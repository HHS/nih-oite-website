When we consider healthy eating habits, most people think about
nutrition or cutting down carbs and calories. While we all know the
importance of eating healthy, we often forget that food nourishes our
mind, body and soul. Food is a part of our cultural identity, it can
provide comfort when we are missing our family and friends, or it can be
a creative hobby. Additionally, cooking and eating healthy can help
build resilience. Join us to talk about your cooking experiences, share
how cooking has inspired you, and explore what would you like to learn
to prepare in the future.

This event is only for NIH Intramural Trainees currently in our postbac,
graduate student, and postdoc programs. This session will be held online
via Zoom and the link will be distributed in NIH Trainee Listserv
announcements. If you need the link immediately please email
OITE@nih.gov.
