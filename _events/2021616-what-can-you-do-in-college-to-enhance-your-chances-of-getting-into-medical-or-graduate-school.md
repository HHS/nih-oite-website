If you are heading back to school soon, you may be asking yourself how
to use that time wisely. What should you do during those 4 years of
college to make yourself competitive for medical (or dental) school or
graduate school?  Make certain you are prepared for your future career
decisions.

NOTE: High school students (and recent graduates) are encouraged to
participate in the NIH Career Development Series for High School
Students and Recent Graduates, Part V: Success in College on July 28,
2021, instead of this workshop.
