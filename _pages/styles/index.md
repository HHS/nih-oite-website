Tables are used to present structured, tabular data to your readers. They are _not_ used to arrange things for presentation (see [Columns](#columns) for that)

| -- | -- | -- |
| This a table. | You can put data in columns. | 42 |
| What if you wanted multiple lines in a table cell? | Then you need to <br> use _HTML_ | 43 |
| Specfically |  you want to use `<br>` | 44 |
