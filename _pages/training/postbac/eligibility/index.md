## There isn't a required minimum GPA

While there isn't a required GPA, NIH investigators will select postbacs
who appear likely to make the greatest contribution to the research
group. Investigators can use the GPA field to filter the applications.
Postbacs accepted into the program rarely have an undergraduate GPA
lower than 3.0.
