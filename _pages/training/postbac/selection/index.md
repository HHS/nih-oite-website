# How applicants are selected for the postbac research training program

## NIH principal investigators select their own postbacs

Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis year-round by scientists in
NIH institutes. Individual PIs select, and provide funding for, their
own postbacs.

## You must contact principal investigators to find a position

After you submit your application you must contact principal
investigators (PIs) to find a position at NIH institute or center.
[Learn how to find a project you want to work on and contact
PIs].

## You will be informed by the hiring institute if you've been selected 

If you are selected by a PI you will be required to submit the following
documentation to your institute prior to beginning your training:

-   Official college transcript(s)

-   Proof of U.S. citizenship or permanent resident status. U.S.
    > citizens must submit a copy of their birth certificate or
    > passport. Permanent residents must provide a copy of their
    > permanent resident (green) card.

## Applications are archived one year after they're submitted

Applications are no longer accessible to NIH investigators one year
after they're submitted or when an applicant is no longer eligible for
the postbac program, whichever comes first.
