# After you apply, find a project

## Find projects you're interested in and then contact the principal investigators to find a position

After you submit your application, find projects you're interested in
and then contact the principal investigators (PIs) who are leading those
projects. **PIs select postbacs to work on their projects**.

There are **two options** for beginning your search. You can search NIH
research reports or review a list of research topics.

### **Search NIH research reports to find projects that interest you** 

-   Go to [NIH intramural research
    > reports](https://intramural.nih.gov/search/index.taf).

-   Select a year. Hit "Continue."

-   Select one or all institutes and centers. Hit "Continue."

-   Enter your keywords.

### **View research topics for principal investigators**

Explore the [research topics] [of principal
investigators](https://irp.nih.gov/our-research/principal-investigators/focus).

## Email principal investigators to be considered for their projects

Once you find projects that you'd like to work on, email the PIs who
lead those projects and request that they consider your application.

Do not send a general email to dozens of investigators. Instead,
identify four or five PIs whose work interests you. Learn enough about
what they're working on so that you can write focused, specific emails
describing why you would like to work with them.

## More about finding a research home at NIH

The decision to come to the NIH as a postbac is an important one. You
are commiting a year or two of your life to an in-depth research
experience. Please [review our guidelines on] [choosing a
mentor](https://www.training.nih.gov/mentoring_guidelines)
before making this decision. The document discusses questions you should
ask a potential mentor, questions you might ask other students in the
research group, and recommendations regarding identifying what you need
from a mentor and evaluating your options.
