#  Postbac research training program

***Work side-by-side with leading scientists in an environment devoted
to biomedical research***

## This program is for recent college graduates who plan to attend graduate or professional school

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) postbaccalaureate research
training program provides recent college graduates an opportunity to
perform biomedical research at the NIH for one to two years. Postbacs
accepted into the program are expected to apply to graduate or
professional (medical, dental, pharmacy, nursing, veterinary) school
during their time at the NIH.

## Postbacs work with principal investigators at NIH facilities

After you submit your application you must contact principal
investigators (PIs) to find a position at an NIH facility. [Learn how
to find a project you want to work on and contact
PIs](#after-you-apply-find-a-project).

NIH postbacs have a scientific \"home\" in the NIH Institute or Center
(IC) of your PI. The IC manages all of the administrative details of the
postbac appointment and provides scientific and career enrichment
activities.

The NIH Office of Intramural Training & Education (OITE) sponsors career
and professional development activities for postbacs on many topics
including:

-   Oral and poster presentations

-   Improving mentoring relationships

-   Getting to graduate school or professional school

-   Career exploration sessions

-   Wellness activities

-   Graduate & professional school fair

-   Postbac poster day

## There are two postbac program options

Eligible students can apply to the postbac research training program
described on this page. You may also be eligible to apply for the [OITE
postbac enrichment program
(OITE-PEP)](https://www.training.nih.gov/nih_oite_postbac_enrichment_program).
The OITE-PEP is designed to encourage candidates from diverse
backgrounds and experiences to perform biomedical research at the NIH
while developing their scientific, leadership, and professional skills.
OITE-PEP applicants should be committed to pursuing a career in
biomedical science and plan to attend graduate or professional school.
We encourage applications from students in all science disciplines. The
OITE-PEP has its own eligibility criteria, application deadlines, and
program curricula. View the [postbac program comparison
chart](https://www.training.nih.gov/postbac_programs_comparison_chart)
to learn more about your options.

## The minimum time commitment is 12 months

Most trainees spend one to two years at NIH. In limited cases, a trainee
could be extended for a third year.

## You can apply anytime

Applications are accepted year-round. Start and end dates are negotiated
individually between you and the NIH investigator who selected you. Most
postbacs begin in June or July.

We recommend that you apply six to nine months prior to the date you
want to start.

## The stipend amount depends on your experience

| Degree / years of experience | Initial stipend | Second year stipend* |
| -- | -- | -- |
| BA/BS with 0-1 year  | $34,750 | $37,300 |
| BA/BS with 1-2 years | $37,300 | $39,000 |
| BA/BS with 2+ years  | $39,000 | $40,700 |
| Master's             | $39,000 | $40,700 |

\*The second-year stipend is used for postbacs in an exceptional third
year.

Stipends are adjusted annually and are the same for all NIH locations.
These rates are effective as of May 1, 2022.

## NIH does not provide housing

The NIH does not provide housing for trainees. We can offer some
information that may help you find a place to live.

## Health insurance is required for all postbacs

The NIH pays for low-option individual or family coverage available
through the Foundation for Advanced Education in the Sciences (FAES). If
you want an FAES policy with more extensive coverage than we provide,
you will be required to pay the difference. If you're already insured on
another policy you can remain on that policy if you provide evidence of
coverage. NIH will reimburse you for the cost incurred up to the amount
we would have paid for FAES coverage. [Read more about the FAES
insurance
program](https://faes.org/content/health-insurance-services).
