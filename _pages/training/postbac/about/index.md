> Work side-by-side with leading scientists in an environment devoted to biomedical research

## About the program

This program is for recent college graduates who plan to attend graduate or professional school.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Postbaccalaureate Research Training Program provides recent college graduates an opportunity to perform biomedical research full-time at the NIH for one to two years. Postbacs accepted into the program are expected to apply to graduate or professional (medical, dental, pharmacy, nursing, veterinary) school during their time at the NIH.

### Postbacs work with principal investigators at NIH facilities

After you submit your application you must contact principal investigators (PI) to find a position at an NIH facility. (More on contacting PIs and finding a project you want to work on)

NIH postbacs have a scientific "home" in the NIH Institute or Center (IC) of your PI.  The IC manages all of the administrative details of the postbac appointment and provides scientific and career enrichment activities. 

The NIH Office of Intramural Training & Education (OITE) sponsors a wide range of career and professional development activities for postbacs, including workshops on many topics including:

* Oral and poster presentations
* Improving mentoring relationships
* Getting to graduate school or professional school
* Career exploration sessions 
* Wellness activities
* Graduate & Professional School Fair
* Postbac Poster Day

### NIH does not provide housing

The NIH does not provide housing for trainees. We can offer some information that may help you find a place to live.

### Health insurance is required for all postbacs

The NIH pays for low-option individual or family coverage available through the Foundation for Advanced Education in the Sciences (FAES). If you want an FAES policy with more extensive coverage than we provide, you will be required to pay the difference. If you’re already insured on another policy you can remain on that policy if you provide evidence of coverage. NIH will reimburse you for the cost incurred up to the amount we would have paid for FAES coverage. Read more about the FAES insurance program.
