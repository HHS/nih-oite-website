# About OITE events

The NIH Office of Intramural Training & Education (OITE) provides free events for the biomedical research community including current NIH trainees, other members of the NIH community, and the public. We offer events related to wellness, personal and professional development, career services, science skills, ethics, and more.

## Current NIH trainees: check your institute’s calendar for more events

If you are a current NIH trainee, check your institute’s site for additional events. This is especially important if you are a trainee at a campus other than the NIH main campus in Bethesda, MD.
