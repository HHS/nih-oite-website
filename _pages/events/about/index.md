# About OITE events

The NIH Office of Intramural Training & Education (OITE) provides free events for the biomedical research community including current NIH trainees, other members of the NIH community, and the public. We offer events related to wellness, personal and professional development, career services, science skills, ethics, and more. 

## Accessibility

If you need interpreting services and/or other reasonable accommodations to participate in an event, contact <OITE-EventServices@od.nih.gov>. Or, if you regularly request services through the NIH Interpreting Office, contact them at nih@ainterpreting.com. American Sign Language interpreting services, CART services, and other reasonable accommodations are available. Requests should be made at least five business days in advance, when possible, to ensure interpreter availability. 

## Current NIH trainees: check your institute’s calendar for more events

If you are a current NIH trainee, check your institute’s site for additional events. This is especially important if you are a trainee at a campus other than the NIH main campus in Bethesda, MD.
